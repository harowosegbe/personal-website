I’m a Senior Software Engineer and founder of SwiftXR, a platform empowering users to create immersive 3D, AR, and VR experiences without writing code. 
Originally from Lagos, Nigeria, I specialize in XR (Extended Reality) and 3D technologies, working extensively in AR/VR development and CAD simulations.

My journey started with Unity AR/VR solutions, which led to the founding of SwiftXR, now utilized by over 60,000 users worldwide. I’ve collaborated on large-scale projects across industries like renewable energy and interactive design, focusing on real-world XR applications such as solar panel simulations and metaverse development.

## Technical contributions
- Developed SwiftXR, a no-code platform enabling 60,000+ users to create 3D, AR, and VR experiences, streamlining immersive content creation.
- Created custom AR/VR components using the Meta WebXR SDK for improved 3D model interactions.
- Designed a 3D NFT tool for converting 2D images into interactive 3D art, used by over 8,000 creators.
- Developed a solar rooftop design platform, integrating CAD models with 3D simulations, which has been adopted by multiple energy firms.
- Built a cross-platform VR game with audio-visual-haptic feedback, reaching 15,000+ downloads.
- Authored various AR/VR-based simulation and design tools, benefiting thousands of users globally in industries like architecture, education, and entertainment.
